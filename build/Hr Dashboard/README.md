# HR Analytics Interactive Dashboard
**📊 Project Overview**

This project is a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard built to transform raw employee data into actionable business intelligence. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of workforce health, enabling HR professionals to track recruitment, retention, and employee demographics in real-time.

**📂 Data Schema**

The project utilizes a primary HR_Data table containing comprehensive employee records. Each row represents a unique employee, enabling granular analysis across various dimensions.

**🎯 Key Objectives**

Monitor Workforce Growth: Track hiring trends over time to manage recruitment cycles.

Analyze Retention: Identify patterns in employee terminations and maintain an accurate count of active staff.

Demographic Mapping: Understand the diversity and geographic distribution of the workforce.

Enhance Data Storytelling: Utilize advanced UI/UX design principles to make complex data easy to digest.

**🚀 Dashboard Features**

Executive Summary (KPIs): Instant visibility into "Total Hired," "Active Employees," and "Termination Rate."

Temporal Trends: Line charts showing hiring velocity over several years to identify growth spurts.

Geospatial Analysis: An interactive map visualizing employee concentration by state and region.

Workforce Composition: Breakdown of the organization by Gender, Department, and Job Title.

Advanced UI Design: A custom-layered interface featuring rounded containers, soft shadows, and a modern "Dark Mode" aesthetic for professional presentation.

**🛠️ Technical Implementation**

Data Modeling: Structured a flat-file data model to optimize Tableau performance and simplify relationships.

Calculated Fields: Developed custom DAX-style formulas in Tableau to handle dynamic date filtering and status logic (e.g., determining if an employee is currently active based on termination dates).

Interactive Filtering: Integrated global filters for Department and Date Range, allowing users to drill down into specific subsets of data.

UI/UX Optimization: Employed a "Floating Container" strategy with custom background templates to achieve a design-first look that goes beyond standard Tableau defaults.
